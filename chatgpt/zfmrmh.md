> what is the easiest way to deploy a serverless aws lambda using cli

Deploying a serverless AWS Lambda function using the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) is relatively straightforward. Here are the general steps:

1.  Write your Lambda function code and package it in a zip file. Make sure you include any dependencies or libraries that your function needs.
    
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS account credentials.
    
3.  Use the AWS CLI to create a new Lambda function by running the following command:
    

python

```python
aws lambda create-function --function-name MyFunction --runtime python3.8 --zip-file fileb://function.zip --handler lambda_function.handler --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyLambdaRole
```

In this command, replace `MyFunction` with the name of your function, `function.zip` with the name of your zip file, and `MyLambdaRole` with the ARN of the IAM role that your Lambda function should use. You should also specify the runtime and handler for your function.

4.  Once your function is created, you can invoke it using the AWS CLI by running a command like this:

css

```css
aws lambda invoke --function-name MyFunction --payload '{"key": "value"}' output.json
```

This command will invoke your Lambda function with the specified payload and write the output to a file named `output.json`.

These are just the basic steps for deploying a simple Lambda function. Depending on your needs, you may need to configure additional settings, such as environment variables, event triggers, or VPC settings. You can find more information about deploying and managing Lambda functions using the AWS CLI in the AWS documentation.

> what about the CI CD pipeline

Deploying AWS Lambda functions using a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline can help streamline the development and deployment process. Here's a general outline of how you can set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your Lambda functions using the AWS CLI:

1.  Set up your development environment by installing the AWS CLI, Git, and any other necessary tools.
    
2.  Create a new Git repository for your Lambda function code.
    
3.  Write your Lambda function code and any necessary tests, and commit your code to the Git repository.
    
4.  Set up a CI tool (such as Jenkins, CircleCI, or Travis CI) to automatically build and test your Lambda function code whenever changes are committed to the Git repository.
    
5.  Configure your CI tool to package your Lambda function code into a zip file and upload it to an S3 bucket in your AWS account.
    
6.  Set up a CD tool (such as AWS CodeDeploy or AWS CodePipeline) to automatically deploy your Lambda function code to your AWS account whenever a new zip file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
    
7.  Configure your CD tool to use the AWS CLI to create or update your Lambda function with the new code package.
    
8.  Optionally, you can also configure your CD tool to automatically test your Lambda function after it has been deployed, and to roll back to a previous version if the tests fail.
    

By setting up a CI/CD pipeline, you can automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your Lambda function code, which can help reduce errors and improve the speed and reliability of your deployments.

> Walk me through hello world python rest service soup to nuts

Sure, here is a walkthrough for creating a "Hello World" Python REST service from scratch:

1.  Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
    
2.  Initialize a new Git repository by running the command `git init`.
    
3.  Create a new virtual environment for your Python project by running the command `python3 -m venv venv`.
    
4.  Activate the virtual environment by running the command `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows).
    
5.  Install the Flask library (which we will use to create the REST service) by running the command `pip install flask`.
    
6.  Create a new Python file called `app.py` and open it in your text editor.
    
7.  In `app.py`, import the Flask library and create a new Flask app:
    

python

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
```

8.  Create a new route for your app by defining a function that returns a "Hello World" message. For example:

python

```python
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

9.  Save the `app.py` file and exit your text editor.
    
10.  In your terminal, run the command `export FLASK_APP=app.py` (or `set FLASK_APP=app.py` on Windows) to tell Flask which Python file to use as the entry point for your app.
    
11.  Run the command `flask run` to start the Flask development server.
    
12.  Open your web browser and go to the URL `http://localhost:5000/`. You should see a "Hello, World!" message displayed in your browser.
    

Congratulations! You have just created a simple Python REST service using Flask. Of course, this is just a basic example, and you can do much more with Flask and Python to create more complex REST services with databases, authentication, and more. But this should give you a good starting point for exploring the world of Python web development.

> this is for a lambda?

My apologies, I misunderstood your initial request. Here's a walk-through for creating a "Hello World" Python REST service using AWS Lambda and API Gateway:

1.  Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
    
2.  Initialize a new Git repository by running the command `git init`.
    
3.  Create a new virtual environment for your Python project by running the command `python3 -m venv venv`.
    
4.  Activate the virtual environment by running the command `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows).
    
5.  Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) by running the command `pip install boto3`.
    
6.  Install the Flask library (which we will use to create the REST service) by running the command `pip install flask`.
    
7.  Create a new Python file called `app.py` and open it in your text editor.
    
8.  In `app.py`, import the Flask library and create a new Flask app:
    

python

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
```

9.  Create a new route for your app by defining a function that returns a "Hello World" message. For example:

python

```python
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

10.  Create a new Python file called `lambda_function.py` and open it in your text editor.
    
11.  In `lambda_function.py`, import the Boto3 library and create a new function that calls your Flask app:
    

scss

```scss
import boto3
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('apigatewaymanagementapi', endpoint_url='https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/')
    response = app.test_client().get('/')
    client.post_to_connection(ConnectionId=event['requestContext']['connectionId'], Data=response.data)
    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'Message sent.'}
```

Replace `<api-id>` and `<region>` with the ID of your API Gateway API and the region where your API is hosted, respectively.

12.  Save both `app.py` and `lambda_function.py` and exit your text editor.
    
13.  In your terminal, create a new ZIP file that includes both `app.py` and `lambda_function.py` by running the command `zip function.zip app.py lambda_function.py`.
    
14.  In the AWS Management Console, create a new Lambda function using the ZIP file you just created as the function code.
    
15.  Create a new API Gateway API and add a new WebSocket route that maps to your Lambda function.
    
16.  Deploy your API Gateway API and test your REST service by connecting to it using a WebSocket client and sending a message to the `/` route.
    

Congratulations! You have just created a simple Python REST service using Flask and AWS Lambda. Of course, this is just a basic example, and you can do much more with Flask and Lambda to create more complex REST services with databases, authentication, and more. But this should give you a good starting point for exploring the world of Python web development on AWS.
