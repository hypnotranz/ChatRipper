Model: Default

> give me a user table for an enterprise application

Sure! Here is an example of a user table for an enterprise application:

```
| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user\_id | integer | Unique identifier for the user |
| username | varchar | Unique username for the user |
| password | varchar | Encrypted password for the user |
| first\_name | varchar | First name of the user |
| last\_name | varchar | Last name of the user |
| email | varchar | Email address of the user |
| phone\_number | varchar | Phone number of the user |
| department\_id | integer | Foreign key to department table indicating the user's department |
| role\_id | integer | Foreign key to role table indicating the user's role |
| is\_active | boolean | Indicates whether the user is active or inactive |
| created\_at | timestamp | Timestamp for when the user was created |
| updated\_at | timestamp | Timestamp for when the user was last updated |
```

Note: This is just an example, and the actual table structure may vary depending on the specific requirements of your enterprise application.

> now give me the crud stored procs

Certainly! Here are some examples of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) stored procedures for the user table:

1.  Create User:

sql

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spCreateUser 
    @username varchar(50), 
    @password varchar(50), 
    @first_name varchar(50), 
    @last_name varchar(50), 
    @email varchar(50),
    @phone_number varchar(50),
    @department_id int,
    @role_id int
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO users (username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id)
    VALUES (@username, @password, @first_name, @last_name, @email, @phone_number, @department_id, @role_id)
END
```

2.  Read User:

sql

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spGetUser 
    @user_id int
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = @user_id
END
```

3.  Update User:

sql

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spUpdateUser 
    @user_id int, 
    @username varchar(50), 
    @password varchar(50), 
    @first_name varchar(50), 
    @last_name varchar(50), 
    @email varchar(50),
    @phone_number varchar(50),
    @department_id int,
    @role_id int
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE users SET 
        username = @username, 
        password = @password, 
        first_name = @first_name, 
        last_name = @last_name, 
        email = @email,
        phone_number = @phone_number,
        department_id = @department_id,
        role_id = @role_id
    WHERE user_id = @user_id
END
```

4.  Delete User:

sql

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spDeleteUser 
    @user_id int
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM users WHERE user_id = @user_id
END
```

Note: These are just examples, and the actual stored procedures may vary depending on the specific requirements of your enterprise application. Additionally, these procedures may need additional validation to ensure data consistency and security.

> now give me data services to call them in python

Sure, here are some example data services in Python to call the CRUD stored procedures we created earlier:

1.  Create User:

python

```python
import pyodbc

def create_user(username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id):
    connection = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=<server_name>;DATABASE=<database_name>;UID=<username>;PWD=<password>')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("EXEC spCreateUser ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?", (username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id))
    connection.commit()
    connection.close()
```

2.  Read User:

python

```python
import pyodbc

def get_user(user_id):
    connection = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=<server_name>;DATABASE=<database_name>;UID=<username>;PWD=<password>')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("EXEC spGetUser ?", (user_id,))
    user = cursor.fetchone()
    connection.close()
    return user
```

3.  Update User:

python

```python
import pyodbc

def update_user(user_id, username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id):
    connection = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=<server_name>;DATABASE=<database_name>;UID=<username>;PWD=<password>')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("EXEC spUpdateUser ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?", (user_id, username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id))
    connection.commit()
    connection.close()
```

4.  Delete User:

python

```python
import pyodbc

def delete_user(user_id):
    connection = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=<server_name>;DATABASE=<database_name>;UID=<username>;PWD=<password>')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("EXEC spDeleteUser ?", (user_id,))
    connection.commit()
    connection.close()
```

Note: Replace `<server_name>`, `<database_name>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with the appropriate values for your database. Additionally, these data services may need additional error handling to ensure that any exceptions are handled properly.

> now give me the domain classes

Certainly! Here are some example domain classes for the user table:

python

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id, username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.email = email
        self.phone_number = phone_number
        self.department_id = department_id
        self.role_id = role_id
        self.is_active = is_active
        self.created_at = created_at
        self.updated_at = updated_at
```

Note: This is just an example, and the actual domain classes may vary depending on the specific requirements of your enterprise application. Additionally, these classes may need additional methods to perform domain-specific operations on the user data.

> now give me input and output models for a rest service that manages create, update, deactivate, and login for the user

Sure, here are some example input and output models for a REST service that manages create, update, deactivate, and login for the user:

1.  Create User Input Model:

python

```python
class CreateUserInputModel:
    def __init__(self, username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.email = email
        self.phone_number = phone_number
        self.department_id = department_id
        self.role_id = role_id
```

2.  Create User Output Model:

python

```python
class CreateUserOutputModel:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
```

3.  Update User Input Model:

python

```python
class UpdateUserInputModel:
    def __init__(self, username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.email = email
        self.phone_number = phone_number
        self.department_id = department_id
        self.role_id = role_id
```

4.  Deactivate User Input Model:

python

```python
class DeactivateUserInputModel:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
```

5.  Login Input Model:

python

```python
class LoginInputModel:
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
```

6.  Login Output Model:

python

```python
class LoginOutputModel:
    def __init__(self, token):
        self.token = token
```

Note: This is just an example, and the actual input and output models may vary depending on the specific requirements of your enterprise application. Additionally, these models may need additional validation to ensure that the input is in the correct format and that the output conforms to the expected schema.

> now the mappers

Sure, here are some example mappers to map between the domain model and the input/output models:

1.  Create User Mapper:

python

```python
from datetime import datetime

class CreateUserMapper:
    @staticmethod
    def to_domain_model(input_model):
        return User(
            None,
            input_model.username,
            input_model.password,
            input_model.first_name,
            input_model.last_name,
            input_model.email,
            input_model.phone_number,
            input_model.department_id,
            input_model.role_id,
            True,
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now()
        )

    @staticmethod
    def to_output_model(domain_model):
        return CreateUserOutputModel(domain_model.user_id)
```

2.  Update User Mapper:

python

```python
class UpdateUserMapper:
    @staticmethod
    def to_domain_model(user_id, input_model):
        return User(
            user_id,
            input_model.username,
            input_model.password,
            input_model.first_name,
            input_model.last_name,
            input_model.email,
            input_model.phone_number,
            input_model.department_id,
            input_model.role_id,
            True,
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now()
        )
```

3.  Deactivate User Mapper:

python

```python
class DeactivateUserMapper:
    @staticmethod
    def to_domain_model(input_model):
        return User(
            input_model.user_id,
            None,
            None,
            None,
            None,
            None,
            None,
            None,
            None,
            False,
            None,
            datetime.now()
        )
```

4.  Login Mapper:

python

```python
class LoginMapper:
    @staticmethod
    def to_domain_model(input_model):
        return (input_model.username, input_model.password)

    @staticmethod
    def to_output_model(token):
        return LoginOutputModel(token)
```

Note: This is just an example, and the actual mappers may vary depending on the specific requirements of your enterprise application. Additionally, these mappers may need additional logic to handle cases where the input/output models are not in the expected format.

> now the rest service controllers

Sure, here are some example REST service controllers for the user operations:

1.  Create User Controller:

python

```python
from flask import request
from flask_restful import Resource
from myapp.domain.user import User
from myapp.models.user import CreateUserInputModel, CreateUserOutputModel
from myapp.mappers.user import CreateUserMapper

class UserController(Resource):
    def post(self):
        input_model = CreateUserInputModel(**request.get_json())
        domain_model = CreateUserMapper.to_domain_model(input_model)
        user_id = User.create(domain_model)
        output_model = CreateUserMapper.to_output_model(domain_model)
        return output_model.__dict__, 201
```

2.  Update User Controller:

python

```python
from flask import request
from flask_restful import Resource
from myapp.domain.user import User
from myapp.models.user import UpdateUserInputModel
from myapp.mappers.user import UpdateUserMapper

class UserController(Resource):
    def put(self, user_id):
        input_model = UpdateUserInputModel(**request.get_json())
        domain_model = UpdateUserMapper.to_domain_model(user_id, input_model)
        User.update(domain_model)
        return None, 204
```

3.  Deactivate User Controller:

python

```python
from flask import request
from flask_restful import Resource
from myapp.domain.user import User
from myapp.models.user import DeactivateUserInputModel
from myapp.mappers.user import DeactivateUserMapper

class UserController(Resource):
    def delete(self):
        input_model = DeactivateUserInputModel(**request.get_json())
        domain_model = DeactivateUserMapper.to_domain_model(input_model)
        User.deactivate(domain_model)
        return None, 204
```

4.  Login Controller:

python

```python
from flask import request
from flask_restful import Resource
from myapp.domain.user import User
from myapp.models.user import LoginInputModel, LoginOutputModel
from myapp.mappers.user import LoginMapper

class LoginController(Resource):
    def post(self):
        input_model = LoginInputModel(**request.get_json())
        domain_model = LoginMapper.to_domain_model(input_model)
        token = User.login(*domain_model)
        output_model = LoginMapper.to_output_model(token)
        return output_model.__dict__, 200
```

Note: This is just an example, and the actual controllers may vary depending on the specific requirements of your enterprise application. Additionally, these controllers may need additional error handling to ensure that any exceptions are handled properly.

> give me an upsert

Sure, here's an example of an upsert stored procedure for the user table:

sql

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spUpsertUser 
    @user_id int,
    @username varchar(50), 
    @password varchar(50), 
    @first_name varchar(50), 
    @last_name varchar(50), 
    @email varchar(50),
    @phone_number varchar(50),
    @department_id int,
    @role_id int,
    @is_active bit
AS
BEGIN
    IF @user_id IS NULL
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO users (username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
        VALUES (@username, @password, @first_name, @last_name, @email, 
                @phone_number, @department_id, @role_id, @is_active, GETDATE(), GETDATE())
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        UPDATE users SET 
            username = @username, 
            password = @password, 
            first_name = @first_name, 
            last_name = @last_name, 
            email = @email,
            phone_number = @phone_number,
            department_id = @department_id,
            role_id = @role_id,
            is_active = @is_active,
            updated_at = GETDATE()
        WHERE user_id = @user_id
    END
END
```

Note: This upsert stored procedure will either insert a new user if the `user_id` is `NULL` or update an existing user if the `user_id` is not `NULL`. The `created_at` and `updated_at` columns are set using the `GETDATE()` function, which returns the current date and time in SQL Server. This is just an example, and the actual upsert stored procedure may vary depending on the specific requirements of your enterprise application.

> the onus is still on me to know whether or not the user exists

Yes, you are correct. The upsert stored procedure I provided assumes that you already know whether the user exists or not, and it simply performs either an insert or an update operation based on that information.

If you need to check whether the user exists before performing the upsert operation, you can modify the stored procedure to include a SELECT statement that checks for the existence of the user. Here is an updated version of the stored procedure that includes such a check:

sql

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spUpsertUser 
    @user_id int,
    @username varchar(50), 
    @password varchar(50), 
    @first_name varchar(50), 
    @last_name varchar(50), 
    @email varchar(50),
    @phone_number varchar(50),
    @department_id int,
    @role_id int,
    @is_active bit
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @existing_user_id int
    SELECT @existing_user_id = user_id FROM users WHERE user_id = @user_id

    IF @existing_user_id IS NULL
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO users (username, password, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, department_id, role_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
        VALUES (@username, @password, @first_name, @last_name, @email, 
                @phone_number, @department_id, @role_id, @is_active, GETDATE(), GETDATE())
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        UPDATE users SET 
            username = @username, 
            password = @password, 
            first_name = @first_name, 
            last_name = @last_name, 
            email = @email,
            phone_number = @phone_number,
            department_id = @department_id,
            role_id = @role_id,
            is_active = @is_active,
            updated_at = GETDATE()
        WHERE user_id = @existing_user_id
    END
END
```

This stored procedure first checks whether the user with the given `user_id` exists by selecting the `user_id` from the `users` table. If the `user_id` is not found, then the stored procedure performs an insert operation to create a new user. If the `user_id` is found, then the stored procedure performs an update operation on the existing user.

Note that this stored procedure assumes that the `user_id` column is unique and can be used to identify a specific user. If the `user_id` is not unique or you need to perform an upsert operation based on other criteria, you may need to modify the stored procedure accordingly.

> list the patterns of enterprise application architecture

Sure! Here are some of the most commonly used patterns of enterprise application architecture:

1.  Layered architecture: This pattern involves organizing the application into multiple layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access layers, to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
    
2.  Domain-driven design (DDD): This pattern involves modeling the domain and its business logic as the primary focus of the application, with the architecture and implementation tailored to support the domain.
    
3.  Service-oriented architecture (SOA): This pattern involves organizing the application into modular services that communicate with each other using standard protocols, such as REST or SOAP.
    
4.  Microservices architecture: This pattern involves breaking down the application into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
    
5.  Event-driven architecture (EDA): This pattern involves organizing the application around events, which are used to trigger actions or update state across different components of the application.
    
6.  Hexagonal architecture: This pattern involves organizing the application into hexagonal layers, with the core business logic at the center and different interfaces, such as user interfaces or data stores, on the outer layers.
    
7.  CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): This pattern separates the read and write operations of an application by using different models and storage for each.
    

Note that these patterns are not mutually exclusive and can be combined in different ways depending on the specific requirements of your enterprise application.

> include all fowler patterns

Certainly! Here are all 24 patterns described in Martin Fowler's book "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture":

1.  Active Record: An object that wraps a row in a database table, encapsulating the database access and business logic for that row.
    
2.  Data Mapper: A layer of objects that moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself.
    
3.  Table Data Gateway: An object that acts as an interface between the application code and a database, encapsulating all the database access logic.
    
4.  Row Data Gateway: An object that acts as an interface between the application code and a database, encapsulating all the database access logic for a single row of a table.
    
5.  Gateway: An object that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, such as a legacy system or an external service.
    
6.  Repository: A layer of objects that provides a collection-like interface to a set of domain objects, abstracting the database access and persistence logic.
    
7.  Identity Map: A cache that stores a mapping between object identities and their corresponding objects, ensuring that each object is represented by only one instance.
    
8.  Unit of Work: A pattern that tracks all the changes made to a set of objects in a transaction, and persisting them to the database as a single transaction.
    
9.  Lazy Load: A pattern that defers the loading of an object until it is actually needed, in order to reduce the number of unnecessary database queries.
    
10.  Value Object: An immutable object that represents a value, such as a date or a currency, and has no identity of its own.
    
11.  Domain Model: An object-oriented representation of the business domain and its rules, used to encapsulate business logic and enable the application to reflect the business accurately.
    
12.  Service Layer: A layer of objects that provides a set of services to the application, encapsulating the business logic and providing a simple interface to the application code.
    
13.  Domain Store: A layer of objects that manages the persistence of domain objects, abstracting the database access and persistence logic.
    
14.  Transaction Script: A pattern that organizes the business logic around individual transactions, with a script for each transaction that manipulates the data directly.
    
15.  Domain Table Module: An object that represents a table in a database, with the business logic for that table encapsulated in the object.
    
16.  Table Module: An object that represents a set of related database tables, with the business logic for those tables encapsulated in the object.
    
17.  Service Layer with Domain Object: A pattern that combines the Service Layer and Domain Model patterns, with the business logic encapsulated in the domain objects.
    
18.  Service Layer with Transaction Script: A pattern that combines the Service Layer and Transaction Script patterns, with the transaction scripts encapsulated in the service layer.
    
19.  Service Layer with Table Module: A pattern that combines the Service Layer and Table Module patterns, with the table modules encapsulating the business logic for a set of related tables.
    
20.  Service Layer with Domain Table Module: A pattern that combines the Service Layer and Domain Table Module patterns, with the domain table modules encapsulating the business logic for a single table.
    
21.  Query Object: An object that encapsulates a query on a database, abstracting the query logic and providing a simple interface to the application code.
    
22.  Repository with Query Object: A pattern that combines the Repository and Query Object patterns, with the query objects encapsulating the query logic and the repositories managing the persistence.
    
23.  Data Transfer Object: An object that encapsulates a set of related data, used to transfer data between layers of the application or between applications.
    
24.  Remote Facade: An object that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem, such as an external service, over a remote interface, such as
    

> give a sample implementation of each. domain classes can be user and user\_profile

Sure, here's an example implementation for each of the 24 patterns using the `User` and `UserProfile` domain classes:

1.  Active Record:

python

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id, username, password):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.username = username
        self.password = password

    def save(self):
        if self.user_id is None:
            # Perform an insert operation
        else:
            # Perform an update operation

class UserProfile:
    def __init__(self, user_profile_id, user_id, first_name, last_name, email):
        self.user_profile_id = user_profile_id
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.email = email

    def save(self):
        if self.user_profile_id is None:
            # Perform an insert operation
        else:
            # Perform an update operation
```

2.  Data Mapper:

python

```python
class UserMapper:
    def __init__(self, db):
        self.db = db
