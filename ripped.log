Assume that you have the ability to summon great minds from any era or place. In this dialogue, include Parmenides and a contemporary cognitive scientist, and have them discuss their views on the nature of reality, knowledge, and the mind. Consider how Parmenides' philosophy of being and non-being relates to the contemporary understanding of cognitive processes and consciousness. Additionally, explore the ways in which Parmenides' ideas may have influenced the development of cognitive science, and how cognitive science may have challenged or confirmed Parmenides' claims. Craft a conversation between the two that illuminates the relationship between Parmenides and cognitive science and offers insights into the nature of reality and the mind.

Pattens that don't currently have names, but nonetheless are pervasive in human thinking. Please give the patten a good name, and then provide a few examples of each. It should look like this, but include new patterns: Pattern: Logical Induction Thinker: Socrates Example 1: taking this concept and this concept, we can prove this
2023-03-10 19:36:58,671 - INFO - Found prompt: > Your task is to extract implicit thought patterns from the writings of great minds that are pervasive in human thinking, but currently do not have names. Assume that you have access to the writings of great minds from any era or place. In this prompt, you should identify and name these patterns, and provide a few examples of each. Your examples should highlight the diversity of thinkers and thought patterns, and illustrate the ways in which these patterns are manifest in human thinking. Pattern: Hyper-connectionism Thinker: Walt Whitman Example 1: "For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you." Example 2: "I am large, I contain multitudes." Pattern: Participatory Epistemology Thinker: Bell Hooks Example 1: "The function of art is to do more than tell it like it is - it's to imagine what is possible." Example 2: "Any theory that cannot be applied to the lives of real people in the real world is a theory that must be rejected." Pattern: Narrative Reclamation Thinker: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Example 1: "The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story." Example 2: "The thing about stereotypes is not that they are false, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story." Pattern: Empathic Validation Thinker: Carl Rogers Example 1: "The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change." Example 2: "People are just as wonderful as sunsets if you let them be. When I look at a sunset, I don't find myself saying, "Soften the orange a bit on the right hand corner." I don't try to control a sunset. I watch with awe as it unfolds." Pattern: Ecological Integration Thinker: Rachel Carson Example 1: "It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose, should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life." Example 2: "The more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction."

2.  Make sure that the DMARC record is published in the correct location in your DNS settings. The DMARC record should be published as a TXT record with the name "\_dmarc.yourdomain.com".
3.  Check that the TTL (time-to-live) value for the DMARC record is not set too high, as this can cause delays in the record propagation.
4.  Wait for up to 48 hours for the DMARC record to propagate fully. DMARC records can take some time to propagate across the internet, so it's important to be patient and wait for the changes to take effect.
5.  Check that the DMARC record is not being overridden by any other conflicting DNS records. For example, if you have multiple TXT records with the same name, this can cause conflicts and prevent the DMARC record from being applied correctly.
6.  Check that the domain specified in the DMARC record matches the domain that you are sending emails from. If the domains do not match, the DMARC record may not be applied correctly.

2.  Domain-driven design (DDD): This pattern involves modeling the domain and its business logic as the primary focus of the application, with the architecture and implementation tailored to support the domain.
3.  Service-oriented architecture (SOA): This pattern involves organizing the application into modular services that communicate with each other using standard protocols, such as REST or SOAP.
4.  Microservices architecture: This pattern involves breaking down the application into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
5.  Event-driven architecture (EDA): This pattern involves organizing the application around events, which are used to trigger actions or update state across different components of the application.
6.  Hexagonal architecture: This pattern involves organizing the application into hexagonal layers, with the core business logic at the center and different interfaces, such as user interfaces or data stores, on the outer layers.
7.  CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): This pattern separates the read and write operations of an application by using different models and storage for each.

7.  Identity Map: A cache that stores a mapping between object identities and their corresponding objects, ensuring that each object is represented by only one instance.
8.  Unit of Work: A pattern that tracks all the changes made to a set of objects in a transaction, and persisting them to the database as a single transaction.
9.  Lazy Load: A pattern that defers the loading of an object until it is actually needed, in order to reduce the number of unnecessary database queries.
10.  Value Object: An immutable object that represents a value, such as a date or a currency, and has no identity of its own.
11.  Domain Model: An object-oriented representation of the business domain and its rules, used to encapsulate business logic and enable the application to reflect the business accurately.
12.  Service Layer: A layer of objects that provides a set of services to the application, encapsulating the business logic and providing a simple interface to the application code.
