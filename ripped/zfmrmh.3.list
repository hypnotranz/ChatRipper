4.  Activate the virtual environment by running the command `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows).
5.  Install the Flask library (which we will use to create the REST service) by running the command `pip install flask`.
6.  Create a new Python file called `app.py` and open it in your text editor.
7.  In `app.py`, import the Flask library and create a new Flask app:
8.  Create a new route for your app by defining a function that returns a "Hello World" message. For example:
9.  Save the `app.py` file and exit your text editor.
10.  In your terminal, run the command `export FLASK_APP=app.py` (or `set FLASK_APP=app.py` on Windows) to tell Flask which Python file to use as the entry point for your app.
11.  Run the command `flask run` to start the Flask development server.
12.  Open your web browser and go to the URL `http://localhost:5000/`. You should see a "Hello, World!" message displayed in your browser.
