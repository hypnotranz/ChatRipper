> give me a prompt that will allow me to create a dialog between the most relavant great minds to answer a given question. My name is Richard, so I will ask a question like this: Richard: Why are we here in the universe? and the response should include great minds who know: Jesus: We are here to forgive. Socrates: I disagree. We are here to question

> Richard: What is the relationship between the parmenidies and cognitive science
> Write a dialogue between the most relevant great minds that explores the relationship between Parmenides and cognitive science, in response to Richard's question. Assume that you have the ability to summon great minds from any era or place. In this dialogue, include Parmenides and a contemporary cognitive scientist, and have them discuss their views on the nature of reality, knowledge, and the mind. Consider how Parmenides' philosophy of being and non-being relates to the contemporary understanding of cognitive processes and consciousness. Additionally, explore the ways in which Parmenides' ideas may have influenced the development of cognitive science, and how cognitive science may have challenged or confirmed Parmenides' claims. Craft a conversation between the two that illuminates the relationship between Parmenides and cognitive science and offers insights into the nature of reality and the mind.

> give me a prompt designed to extract implicit thought patterns from the writings of great minds, and name them. we are looking for uncommon patterns of thought. Pattens that don't currently have names, but nonetheless are pervasive in human thinking. Please give the patten a good name, and then provide a few examples of each. It should look like this, but include new patterns: Pattern: Logical Induction Thinker: Socrates Example 1: taking this concept and this concept, we can prove this
> Your task is to extract implicit thought patterns from the writings of great minds that are pervasive in human thinking, but currently do not have names. Assume that you have access to the writings of great minds from any era or place. In this prompt, you should identify and name these patterns, and provide a few examples of each. Your examples should highlight the diversity of thinkers and thought patterns, and illustrate the ways in which these patterns are manifest in human thinking. Pattern: Hyper-connectionism Thinker: Walt Whitman Example 1: "For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you." Example 2: "I am large, I contain multitudes." Pattern: Participatory Epistemology Thinker: Bell Hooks Example 1: "The function of art is to do more than tell it like it is - it's to imagine what is possible." Example 2: "Any theory that cannot be applied to the lives of real people in the real world is a theory that must be rejected." Pattern: Narrative Reclamation Thinker: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Example 1: "The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story." Example 2: "The thing about stereotypes is not that they are false, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story." Pattern: Empathic Validation Thinker: Carl Rogers Example 1: "The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change." Example 2: "People are just as wonderful as sunsets if you let them be. When I look at a sunset, I don't find myself saying, "Soften the orange a bit on the right hand corner." I don't try to control a sunset. I watch with awe as it unfolds." Pattern: Ecological Integration Thinker: Rachel Carson Example 1: "It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose, should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life." Example 2: "The more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction."
> ok. But lets include examples from multiple thinkers for each
> great. but please demonstrate that the discvovered pattern is novel
> good. keep generating. but make sure you outline the structure of the pattern
> perfect format. now give me some new ones. try to move toward a mathematical domain
> these are great, but I believe they are known patterns. We are looking for new and innovative thought patterns that these great thinkers exhibit, but have not necisarily itentified as a novel path of cognistion
> these are much better. Please include a suggestion at the end for an area of thought or study where each pattern has not been applied, however based on its structure and fit with surrounding concepts, can be applied analogously to this new suggested topic
> this is very good, but instead of Area of Application, I want "New Potential Area of Application"
> great. this format looks great. now keep going with math and computer science oriented thought patterns. be sure to include a novel list each time
> perfect. Please continue. lets try to find these ew potential areas of application such that they are as distant from the original examples in terms of area of study as possible. For example, perhaps there is a link between laplace transforms and bhuddist thought or the musical composition.

For example, perhaps there is a link between laplace transforms and bhuddist thought or the musical composition or the art of dance or metaphysics.
> excellent. but these seem well known. we are looking for more obscure patterns that these great thinkers must implicitly have built into their cognition. some underlying commonality in the process of cognition that yeilds these great insights. perhaps they are meta to the patterns being currently generated
> these are very good. now give me some very basic pattens from early roots like logical reasoning, or geometry, so that your reasoning process can be confirmed. we can come back to more complex patterns later. for now, lets mine for innovation which has gone un-noticed within more basic areas.
> perfect. lets get even more basic. we want to get to the roots of human cognition
> perfect. keep going. even more basic!
