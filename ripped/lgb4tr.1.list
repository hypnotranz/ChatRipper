1.  Log in to your domain registrar or DNS provider account where you manage your domain's DNS settings.
2.  Create a new TXT record for your domain's SPF record, and set the value to include the following information: "v=spf1 include:\_spf.google.com ~all".
3.  Create a new TXT record for your domain's DKIM record, and set the value to the public key that you can find in your Gmail account's DKIM settings.
4.  Create a new DMARC record for your domain, and set the value to "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:[your@email.com](mailto:your@email.com)". This record instructs email receivers to send DMARC reports to the email address you provide.
