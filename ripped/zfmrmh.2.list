> what about the CI CD pipeline
1.  Set up your development environment by installing the AWS CLI, Git, and any other necessary tools.
2.  Create a new Git repository for your Lambda function code.
3.  Write your Lambda function code and any necessary tests, and commit your code to the Git repository.
4.  Set up a CI tool (such as Jenkins, CircleCI, or Travis CI) to automatically build and test your Lambda function code whenever changes are committed to the Git repository.
5.  Configure your CI tool to package your Lambda function code into a zip file and upload it to an S3 bucket in your AWS account.
6.  Set up a CD tool (such as AWS CodeDeploy or AWS CodePipeline) to automatically deploy your Lambda function code to your AWS account whenever a new zip file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
7.  Configure your CD tool to use the AWS CLI to create or update your Lambda function with the new code package.
8.  Optionally, you can also configure your CD tool to automatically test your Lambda function after it has been deployed, and to roll back to a previous version if the tests fail.
